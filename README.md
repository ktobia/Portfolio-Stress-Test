# Potrfolio-Stress-Test
  
  This project is a web-based Portfolio Stress Testing application that allows users to analyze how their stock portfolios would perform under simulated market shock scenarios. 
Users can input their stock holdings, fetch live market prices, and instantly view the potential impact of events such as market crashes, sector downturns, 
or interest rate shocks. The platform calculates portfolio value changes, highlights worst-case scenarios, and identifies the stocks contributing most to potential losses, 
helping users better understand and manage their portfolio risk.

The application uses the yfinance Python library and Yahoo Finance API to retrieve real-time stock market data. The Google Gemini API is integrated to provide AI-powered insights, 
summaries, and explanations of portfolio risk and stress test results. The frontend is built with React, creating a fast and interactive user interface, while the backend is 
implemented in Python, with optional Java components for additional processing and scalability. This architecture enables real-time analysis and delivers a seamless experience 
suitable for rapid hackathon development.
